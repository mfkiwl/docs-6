RadioLion
=========

The RadioLion dual-antenna, triple-frequency RF Front-End receives, filters, amplifies, down-mixes, and digitizes the raw analog GNSS signals from the antenna(s) to produce a binary stream of intermediate-frequency samples that the receiver computer can process. The board also houses a Bosch BMI088 inertial measurement sensor (IMU).
