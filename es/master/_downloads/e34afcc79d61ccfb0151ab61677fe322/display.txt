This is a placeholder for documentation on the GRID text display.

Status indicator decorations:

s --- spoofing detected
* --- half cycle phase offset possible
c --- data bit container complete (wipeoff will be highly accurate)
- --- phase error detected


In addition, if the line is blue, this indicates that the DLL has yet to
settle into its steady-state (most accurate) tracking regime.
