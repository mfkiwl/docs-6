This file defines the columns of data in the navsol.log files produced by the
GRID software receiver. Each navsol.log file contains time-stamped navigation
solutions that represent the receiver's best estimate of position, velocity,
receiver clock error, and receiver clock error rate as calculated from data
provided by all participating receiver banks.  See channel.txt for a
definition of ORT.  ORT time stamps indicate the time at which the navigation
solution applies.

Column        Quantity

1 ----------- ORT week number. 

2 ----------- ORT whole seconds of week.

3 ----------- ORT fractional second. 

4,5,6 ------- X,Y,Z receiver antenna position expressed in meters the ECEF
              reference frame.

7 ----------- deltR, the receiver clock error expressed in equivalent meters.
              True GPS time (TGT) is related to deltR by TGT = ORT - deltR/c.

8,9,10 ------ Xdot,Ydot,Zdot receiver antenna velocity relative to the ECEF
              reference frame expressed in meters per second in the ECEF
              frame.

11 ---------- deltRdot, the receiver clock error rate expressed in equivalent
              meters per second.

12 ---------- Flag returned from the navigation solver:
              0   SOL_NO_FIX
              1   SOL_PRELIMINARY_FIX
              2   SOL_STANDARD_FIX
              3   SOL_PRECISE_FIX

13 ---------- NISratio: ratio of normalized innovation squared statistic to
              the total number of measurements. If the estimator is tuned
              properly, this ratio should be near unity.  If it's low (high),
              then the assumed measurement and/or process noise is too
              conservative (optimistic).
