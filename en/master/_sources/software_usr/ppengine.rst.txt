Precise Positioning Engine (ppengine)
=====================================

This page describes how to configure, run, and interpret output from ppengine, which is an implementation of GRID, the General Radionavigation Interfusion Device.

Steps to Enable PPengine
------------------------

#. Determine if your system has (1) or (2) antennas capability. (2) is preferred if possible. Designate one as the primary antenna. 
 
#. Fix the location of the RadioLion with respect to the antennas.

#. The following steps will describe how to measure the location of the RadioLion IMU with respect to the primary antenna. The RadioLion IMU is located in the red square in the following picture:

.. image:: ./../images/RadioLiondraw.png
   :width: 60 %
   :align: center

The measurements needed to enable **ppengine** are as follows:

#. In the ``a2d.config`` file, change the ``BASELINE_LENGTH_CONSTRAINT`` to the distance between the primary and secondary antenna. This measurement should be the positive X direction between antennas, measured in meters.

#. In the ``ppose.config`` file, change the ``ESTIMATOR_TYPE`` to ``POSE_AND_TWIST_27``. Change the ``POS_ALT1_ANTENNA_B`` to the location of the secondary antenna with respect to the first antenna in the body frame. This is a three coordinate vector (x, y, x), measured in meters. Please be as precise as possible. See the picture below for an example of this calculation on a quadcopter. 

   .. image:: ./../images/body_frame.png
      :width: 80 %
      :align: center

#. In the ``ppose.config`` file, in the ``IMU`` Bank, there are numerous parameters that need to be filled out:

   * For ``IMU_TYPE``, set it to ``IMU_TYPE = CUSTOM2``.
   * ``POS_IMU_B`` is the position of the IMU in the body frame. This is a three coordinate vector (x, y, x), measured in meters. Please be as precise as possible. See the picture below for an example of this calculation on a quadcopter. 

   .. image:: ./../images/body_frame_wr_imu.png
      :width: 80 %
      :align: center

   * ``ORIENTATION_IMU_B`` is a quaternion (4 elements) that represents the rotational position of the IMU with respect to the body frame. See the picture below for an example of the IMU frame vs. the body frame. 

   .. image:: ./../images/imu_in_body_frame.png
      :width: 80 %
      :align: center

      *Optional:* If you have a properly formatted ``pprx.opt`` file, you can run pprx and in the display, the raw specific force components (+X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z) are printed out. Move the RadioLion's IMU to align with each axis and put the six raw specific force components in :download:`this matlab script <./../../src/accelCalibration.m>`. After running the script, the quaternion for the IMU should be printed out for you. This value is the orientation of the IMU w/r to the body frame.

   * To start ``ACCELEROMETER_BIAS_U = 0 0 0`` 
   * To start ``ACCELEROMETER_SCALE_FACTORS_U = 1 1 1`` 
   * To start ``GYRO_BIAS_U = 0 0 0``
   * To start ``GYRO_SCALE_FACTORS_U = 1 1 1`` 

#. Run the start-up script ``stack.py`` (see the page Operational Modes for more details) for a few minutes to obtain a good pprx and ppengine solution. Make sure ppengine is run with the ``-s mat`` option. Collect the output scripts ``diagnostics.log`` and ``poseandtwist.mat``. Save them in a local folder. 

#. Use the following two scripts: :download:`IMU calibration <./../../src/onlineImuCalibration.m>` and :download:`pose and twist analysis <./../../src/poseAndTwistAnal.m>`.

#. In the ``onlineImuCalibration.m`` script, change the parameters ``ORIENTATION_IMU_B``, ``ACCELEROMETER_SCALE_FACTORS_U``, ``GYRO_SCALE_FACTORS_U``, and ``POS_IMU_B`` to what you have set in the previous few steps. Download :download:`this parser<./../../src/diagsplitppe.sh>` and place it in the same folder that you have placed the ``diagnostics.log`` file. Make sure the datadir variable in the matlab script points to where your files are located. 

   The script should output new parameters for ``ORIENTATION_IMU_B``, ``ACCELEROMETER_SCALE_FACTORS_U``, ``GYRO_SCALE_FACTORS_U``. Take these new values and update the ``ppose.config`` file.

#. In the ``poseAndTwistAnal.m`` script, set the current_accel_bias to the value of ``ACCELEROMETER_BIAS_U`` (which for the first time will be 0 0 0) and set the current_gyro_bias to the value of ``GYRO_BIAS_U`` (which for the first time will be 0 0 0). Run the script. The script will output a few different variables, but you will want ``bgU_mean`` and ``baU_mean``. These are the new values for the biases. 

   Take these values and **ADD** them to the previous biases. The first time this is run, the current values are (0 0 0) so the new means will just become the new biases, but this will not be the case on subsequenct runs. These new values for ``ACCELEROMETER_BIAS_U`` and ``GYRO_BIAS_U`` should be placed in the ``ppose.config`` file.

#. With the new values from this process, run ppengine again (you can use the same pprx file you've already collected) and save the ``diagnostics.log`` and ``poseandtwist.mat`` files once again. Repeat these steps a few times or until the numbers converge and stop changing (about 3-4 times).

#. Once this process is done, go back to ``ppose.config`` file, change the ``ESTIMATOR_TYPE`` to ``POSE_AND_TWIST_18``. The IMU is calibrated and precise positioning mode is now tuned to your set-up. 


Editing Options Files
---------------------
ppengine is highly configurable via both command-line options and configuration parameters. Type ``ppengine --help`` to see a list of command-line options. These options are specified in a ``.opt`` file as seen in the *example* below:

.. literalinclude:: ./../../src/runtime_files/ppengine.opt
    :lines: 1-14

Editing Configuration Parameters
--------------------------------
ppengine configuration files are broken into configuration blocks. The start of each block is indicated by a block header, e.g., ESTIMATOR. A ppengine ``.opt`` file (i.e. ppengine.opt) has three corresponding configurations files:

   * ``ppose.config``: See this :download:`example ppose configuration file <./../../src/runtime_files/ppose.config>`.
   * ``a2d.config``: See this :download:`example attitude2d configuration file <./../../src/runtime_files/a2d.config>`.
   * ``sbrtk.config``: See this :download:`example single baseline rtk configuration file <./../../src/runtime_files/sbrtk.config>`.

Each of the three configuration files uses different combinations of blocks. Each block in the ``.config`` file contains various configuration parameters. See each block below to view all of its configuration parameter choices and if applicable the choices for each parameter:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ppengine_config_blocks/cdgnssconf
   ppengine_config_blocks/estimatorconf
   ppengine_config_blocks/pposeestimatorconf
   ppengine_config_blocks/baselineconf
   ppengine_config_blocks/imuconf
   ppengine_config_blocks/difftropoconf

For ``ppose.config`` the following blocks are used:

   * ``PPOSE_ESTIMATOR``
   * ``BASELINE``
   * ``IMU``

For ``a2d.config`` the following blocks are used:

   * ``CDGNSS``
   * ``ESTIMATOR``
   * ``BASELINE``

For ``sbrtk.config`` the following blocks are used:

   * ``CDGNSS``
   * ``ESTIMATOR``
   * ``BASELINE``
   * ``DIFF_TROPO``
   
How to Run
----------

**Examining** ``--help`` **Documentation**
Running the following command

.. code-block:: bash
   
   ppengine --help

will show all the command-line options available for pprx, including a brief description of each.  

**Running pprx**
Suppose ``ppengine.opt`` is a properly-formatted ppengine options file as described :ref:`Editing Options Files`. Navigate to the directory where this file is located and type the following command into the terminal window.

.. code-block:: bash

   ppengine -f ppengine.opt
